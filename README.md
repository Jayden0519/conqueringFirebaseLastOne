Date Submitted: 12/15/22
Partners and Info: This is the final submission of the firebase projects I had been attempting 
definitely one of the more fun projects I had been attempting being able to 
challenge myself and overall gain something out of it. For this semester final
the requirements for this project consisted of a proposal and then we were 
able to independently work on this project with of course a video submission 
and a push to github.
